Accretion Disc[overy] Net Neural Network Emulation Environment

User Stories:
As an artist, I would like to represent my interest in neural network emulation so that I can continue research and development in machine intelligence to support artistic endeavors in support of solving world problems.

Constraints/Acceptance:
1. The network should be modular:
 * The network can be extended and reduced in connectivity, in situ.
 * The network can be extended and reduced in function, in situ.
 * Sub-networks can be joined as part of the extension/reduction.
 * Each network consists of at least one (1) sub-network.
2. The network should be develop capable:
 * The network and its components should be local loggable for replaying activities; for debugging/tuning.
 * The network and its components should be clock lockable for replaying activities; for debugging/tuning.
 * The network and its components should be in a language for wide adoption of large developer pools.
3. The network should be production capable:
 * The network and its components should be clock local.
4. The network should emulate the following Neural Components:
 * Dendrites
 * Axons
 * Soma
 * Dendritic Spines
 * Neurotransmitter Pools
 * Neurotramsmitter Depletion
 * Other activities deemed necessary (TBD)
5. The network should allow communication:
 * Sub-networks between different operations teams
 * Secured communications
 * Low latency communications
 * High bandwidth communications
 * Generic API Adapters for input and motor control systems
6. The network's sub-networks are processed by:
 * Emulated Neural Processors "walk the graph" emulating network activity.
 * Hardware Neural Processors can be implemented for hardware acceleration.
 * Neural Processors execute common runtime routines specified by neural components which are limited by instruction set(s) of the neural processor specification(s).
7. The network's sub-networks should track the following geographic information for purpose of temporal-spatial relationships:
 * Local Coordinate System
 * Global Coordinate System
 * Relative Speeds of Information Propagation
8. The network's sub-networks should be programmable:
 * Neural Modeling Language (NML); serialized human readable network graph (distances and positions included)
 * Neural Computer Aided Design and Drafting; a graphical interface for designing, editing, modeling, implementing, operating and troubleshooting network topology.
