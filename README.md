Accretion Disc[overy] Net Neural Network Emulation Environment

User Stories:
As an artist, I would like to represent my interest in neural network emulation so that I can continue research and development in machine intelligence to support artistic endeavors in support of solving world problems.

Constraints/Acceptance:
1. The network should be modular:
1.1 The network can be extended and reduced in connectivity, in situ.
1.2 The network can be extended and reduced in function, in situ.
1.3 Sub-networks can be joined as part of the extension/reduction.
2. The network should be develop capable:
2.1 The network and its components should be local loggable for replaying activities; for debugging/tuning.
2.2 The network and its components should be clock lockable for replaying activities; for debugging/tuning.
2.3 The network and its components should be in a language for wide adoption of large developer pools.
3. The network should be production capable:
3.1 The network and its components should be clock local.
4. The network should emulate the following:
4.1 Dendrites
4.2 Axons
4.3 Soma
4.4 Dendritic Spines
4.5 Neurotransmitter Pools
4.6 Neurotramsmitter Depletion
4.6 Other activities deemed necessary (TBD)
5. The network should allow TCP/IP Communication between sub-networks
